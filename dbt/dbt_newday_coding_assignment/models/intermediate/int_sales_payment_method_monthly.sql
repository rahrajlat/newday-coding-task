/*

## Question 1:
 Create a dbt model that calculates total revenue by product category for each month. Include basic data transformations and aggregations.
*/


/*

## Question 2:
Extend the previous model to handle edge cases where `order_quantity` is zero
and calculate the percentage of sales coming from each payment method. Handle null values appropriately.
