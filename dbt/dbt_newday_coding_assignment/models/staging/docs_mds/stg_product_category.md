{% docs stg_product_category %}

Here is the explanation of the given SQL code:

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this SQL code is to create a temporary view or result set containing data from the "product_category" table in the "dbt_db" database.

**Logic Flow:**

• The SQL starts by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named CTE_PRODUCT_CATEGORY, which references the "product_category" table in the "dbt_db" database.
• The CTE simply selects all rows (* wildcard) from the "product_category" table.
• The main query then selects all rows (*) from this temporary view or result set (CTE_PRODUCT_CATEGORY).
• This allows for easier querying and manipulation of data from the "product_category" table, as if it were a regular table.
