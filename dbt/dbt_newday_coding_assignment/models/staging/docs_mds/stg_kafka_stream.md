{% docs stg_kafka_stream %}

Here is the explanation:

**Purpose:**
This SQL code defines a temporary view (CTE) and then selects all data from that view, essentially replicating the original table with minimal processing.

**Logic Flow:**

• The SQL code starts by defining a Common Table Expression (CTE) named CTE_KAFKA_STREAM.
• The CTE is defined as a SELECT statement against the "dbt_db"."raw"."kafka_stream" table.
• This effectively creates a temporary view of the original table, which can be useful for simplifying complex queries or improving performance.
• Finally, the code selects all data (*) from this newly created CTE, effectively returning the same data as the original kafka_stream table.
